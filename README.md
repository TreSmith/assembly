# assembly
This repository contains various programs written in the Assembly programming language

1. ShellCodeTre
  - This assignment was given to us in which we had to edit given shellcode to contain no null bytes and be reduced in size while still preforming the desired function
2. Chutesandladders.asm
  - This was my Final Project in my Assembly Language class, I did chutes and ladders for my project. Use spacebar as input to move character
  - As of now it doesn't work outside of the class server, eventually I'll try to get it working
3. 64bitsort
  - Basic program to take input and sort numbers in 64bit, did this in class to learn how to use 64bit assembly vs 32bit
